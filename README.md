# 🪪 Name Changer DApp

This is a simple full-stack decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to interact with a smart contract on the **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet**. Users can:

- Add names to a contract-managed array
- Remove names by index
- Fetch all stored names
- View a name at a specific index
- Connect and interact with the DApp using **MetaMask**

The application itself is very simplistic — the cool part is the fact that all data and interactions are stored and processed directly on the Sepolia blockchain. This means there's no traditional backend; all changes to the data (adding, removing, or reading names) are executed through smart contract functions and recorded immutably on-chain.
